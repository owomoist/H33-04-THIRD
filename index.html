        <h3><b>Computational Materials</b></h3>
        <p>The computational materials project is a stream of the freshman research initiative. FRI is designed to provide undergraduates with an opportunity to participate in research and learn about the process of doing science instead of just learning about scientific results from textbooks. These two aspects of science (the process and the results) are really very different, and in the standard curriculum, we tend to focus on teaching scientific results and neglect showing students how to discover new things. In this stream, students will be taught how to calculate properties of materials using computational methods based upon quantum chemistry and statistical mechanics. Over the course of the spring semester, students will start on their own research projects and work with the stream assistants and mentors to discover properties of new particles or develop computational methods. The students who enjoy and make progress in their research will have the opportunity to continue in the summer, in the fall for undergraduate research credit, and throughout their undergraduate program.</p>
